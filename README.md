Thanks for the opportunity to demonstrate a little of my coding skills for consideration for the position.

- Wired-up the slider in vanilla javascript to avoid the need to add outside scripts. I did notice the use of unslider.js on www.pny.com and could reproduce this exercise using that tool if desired.
- Faithfully reproduced the layouts at the specified break points (1440px, 375px) but added all standard Bootstrap breaks so design works from 285px and up.
- Set position, image/font sizes, margins and padding to replicate design files proportionaly at each break point, and layout is elastic in between. This led to the need to create a custom media query spanning 769px to 1100px to adjust margins/padding to prevent text from covering portions of the image.
- Please reach out if you have any questions or would like to see more examples. robbcab@live.com (732) 390-5996.

Thanks, and enjoy!
